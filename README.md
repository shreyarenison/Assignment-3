# Movie Database Android Application

This project is a Movie Database Android application built using Kotlin and Java, integrated with Firebase for both authentication and real-time data management. The app allows users to register and log in securely using Firebase Authentication. Once logged in, users can perform full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on their personal list of 20 favorite movies, which are stored in Firebase Firestore. The Movie List is displayed using a custom RecyclerView that showcases each movie's title, studio, poster thumbnail, and critics rating. Users can add new movies or edit existing ones through a dedicated Add/Edit screen. Seamless navigation and UI elements ensure a smooth user experience, while proper error handling, such as login failure alerts, enhances usability and security. This app demonstrates core concepts of mobile development, including UI design, user authentication, and cloud-based database interaction.
